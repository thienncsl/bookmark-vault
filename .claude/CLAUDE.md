## Bookmark Vault

A Next.js 14 bookmark manager using App Router, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TailwindCSS for styling
- TypeScript strict mode
- localStorage for persistence (client-side only)

## Code Standards

- Use functional components only
- All components using localStorage must be client components ("use client")
- Use Zod for validation
- Keep components under 100 lines

## File Structure

- `app/` for routes and pages
- `components/` for reusable UI
- `lib/` for utilities and types
- `hooks/` for custom React hooks
