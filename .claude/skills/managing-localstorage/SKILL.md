## localStorage CRUD Pattern

I help with client-side persistence using localStorage.

## Standard Pattern

1. Define TypeScript interface for data
2. Create storage utility with get/add/update/delete
3. Add Zod validation
4. Build custom hook for React integration
5. Handle serialization/deserialization

## Code Template

Storage utility structure:
- STORAGE_KEY constant
- getAll() returns parsed array
- add() pushes and saves
- remove() filters and saves
- search() filters by criteria

## Best Practices

- Always wrap in try-catch for JSON.parse errors
- Validate data with Zod before saving
- Use UUID for IDs (uuid package)
- Handle SSR: check typeof window !== 'undefined'
- Store dates as ISO strings, not Date objects
